<p>I searched the metadata for all the <a
href="https://cfis.wi.gov/Public/Registration.aspx?page=FiledReports#">finance
reports</a> WI has between Jan 2000 and today. There are 65535 of these
reports. Potentially you could search for even earlier dates, but I
think these might be sufficient for us. Here are counts of registrant
types for those 65535 reports:</p>
