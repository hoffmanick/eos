The database also has reports of mainly Late Holocene terrestrial pollen records though Marine records from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are available. The number of records from Mangroves is limited. This also includes pollen records from Archeological sites.","The Indo-Pacific Pollen Database (IPPD) is a collection of modern and fossil Australian,\nSoutheast Asian, and Oceanian pollen assemblages collected from Quaternary period\ndepositional contexts.

The Canadian Museum of Nature Ostracode Database provides modern (after 1850) ostracode assemblage data with associated major ion water chemistry data for the provinces of western Canada.  The Neotoma Ostracode Database provides ostracode data from paleolimnologic sediment cores ranging in age from Pliocene through Holocene in North America.","The NAPMD primarily curates plant macrofossil data from North America, mostly for the late Quaternary.","North American Pollen Database is a pretty good description of region and proxies!  Mostly sediment cores from lakes, mires, and coastal settings, so there are sometimes other proxies.  Time period is mostly Quaternary, but I think there is some Miocene and maybe earlier data","","The work that we're doing at the St. Croix Watershed Research Station (SCWRS) primarily focuses on lead-210 dated cores from the recent past (post 1850). Lead-210 and diatoms are the core proxy types. Most of the records uploaded so far are from the upper midwest region of the United States, but this will likely expand in geographic scope, especially with the addition of more lead-210 records.

In the 1990s, the pollen data were sent to Eric Grimm when he was developing the NAPD (ie before Neotoma), and simply incorporated into the NAPD. Most sites from the CPD in Neotoma are listed as NAPD in origin. Since the mid-1990s the CPD was on the LPC website (lpc.uottawa.ca). Some of the data on the LPC website are simply originals of data Grimm incorporated into the NAPD, but kept there for people who want easy access (Excel spreadsheet). In addition, the LPC website is used to fulfill open-access responsibilities - as a place to put newly created pollen and paleolimnology data (mostly from the Arctic and northern Canada), for modern calibration databases (which include matched microfossil and environmental data), and also for climate reconstructions, protocols, and other work. So although it is being updated, updates are from the LPC lab. ","Please substitute the following text for the current description:\n\n\"The main types of data included in the DPDC are site information, diatom counts, water chemistry and other environmental data, and chronologies. The DPDC was initially funded by NOAA and NSF from 1994 - 2008 with grants to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.  NSF provided continued support to facilitate transfer of data to Neotoma.  Data that were included in the original DPDC and available via the DPDC website at ANSP have not been accessible to retrieve since 2021.  This  constituent database within Neotoma is now the primary source of DPDC data.\n\nData downloaded from this constituent database should be cited, as well as the original source publications and investigators whenever possible. Please use the following as an example: â€œData were obtained from the Diatom Paleolimnology Data Cooperative, a constituent database of the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (https://www.neotomadb.org/). The work of data contributors, data stewards, and the Neotoma and DPDC communities is gratefully acknowledged.â€","The database is not listed.","","ok","It is correct.","I think this is not available yet for the French Institute of Pondicherry Palynology and Paleoecology Database","The following could be added to the front of the existing text:\n\"The Indo-Pacific Pollen Database (IPPD) is a collection of modern and fossil Australian,\nSoutheast Asian, and Oceanian pollen assemblages collected from Quaternary period\ndepositional contexts.\"","","All correct","not listed; The database contains late Pleistocene to Holocene marine dinoflagellate cyst records, mostly from the Northern Hemisphere.","The Neotoma testate amoeba database contains modern surface-samples and stratigraphic records of testate amoebae. ","All three of these databases should give my contact as the steward.  The Canadian Museum of Nature Ostracode Database is closed (not taking new data).  NANODe and Neotoma Ostracode Database are both taking new data, NANODe is surface samples only.  ","it's ok","[Lightly edited/updated:] The North American Pollen Database (NAPD) was launched in 1990 by Eric Grimm at the Illinois State Museum, and drew heavily on precursor efforts by Tom Webb and others at Brown University to gather, organize, and map pollen data for the COHMAP and earlier projects. The NAPD was then incorporated into the Global Pollen Database and was served from NOAA's Paleoclimatology World Data Service, before becoming one of the founding constituent databases of Neotoma.  The NAPD remains active and regularly accepts data contributions from the community.","There is no description of the data base","This constituent database was formed in 2020 with funding from the National Science Foundation. The primary focus is lead-210 dated lake sediment cores from the recent past (post 1850), with lead-210 and diatoms as the core proxy types. The database also contains a number of diatom surface sediment samples from lakes and associated water chemistry values.
