Database</h1>

</div>


<p>FAUNMAP is one of the original Neotoma Constituent Databases. FAUNMAP
was originally developed by Russ Graham and Ernest Lundelius in the
early 1990s with
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=9005144">funding
from the NSF</a>. FAUNMAP initially aggregated mammalian occurrences
from across the United States for the past 50,000 years. In the late
1990s, the temporal reach of the database was extended to encompass the
past five million years. FAUNMAP does contain some data on vertebrate
taxa outside mammals (as well as a few plant and invertebrate
datasets!), but mammals are its primary focus.</p>
<p>FAUNMAP currently contains 6956 datasets from 4847 sites from the
locations mapped below.</p>

Results from the salvage excavation and preliminary analysis o f the human skeletal material were published in a 1987 monograph entitled A Cemetery at Oueen Alia International Airport (Ibrahim and Gordon 1987). In 2000-2001, salvage excavations of the cemetery by the Department o f Antiquities o f Jordan uncovered 52 additional burials that are currently undergoing bioanthropological analysis. The first excavations at Zabayir uncovered a series o f 173 primary interments, oriented roughly east-west, with the head pointing towards the west (Fig. 19; see Ibrahim and Gordon 1987: 16-18). The deceased generally were placed on their backs in rectangular to ovoid graves cut into the soil and covered with limestone slabs quarried from the nearby hills (Fig. 20). One individual was buried in a wooden coffin (R-62) and another in a stone-lined cist (R-47). In addition, one cremation was discovered in a rectangular lead ossuary (R-3). In eleven instances, two individuals were buried side-bvside or nearly on top of each other during the same interment episode. Excavators also discovered three cases of triple concurrent burials. Graves occasionally were re-used after the earlier burial had time to decompose. In five cases, the first burial was swept to the end o f the shaft to make room for a more recent interment. In two cases, the second set of remains was placed on top of the cover slabs of the first.\" (Perry)<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29404>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Wadi Jilat 25<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The sites of Wadi Jilat 13 and 25 were identified in a programme of survey and excavation in the 1970–80s (Baird 1993;1994 ;2001b ; Baird et al. 1992; Garrard 1998; Garrard et al. 1985;1986 ;1987 ;1994a; 1994b; Wright et al. 2008)(Fig. 1). The Wadi Jilat itself is in the Azraq basin, part of the Badia, a classical Arabic word for the semi-arid region. The centre of the basin was the site of a former prehistoric lake (Jones and Richter 2011; Maher et al. 2012), current annual rainfall in the Azraq Basin varies from c. 200 mm in the north-west of the area to less than c. 50 mm in the south-east (Garrard 1998). At present, in some years, water and vegetation are readily available, in others it is severely restricted (Lancaster and Lancaster 1991). Thus, the area is characterized by drought-tolerant IranoTuranian vegetation, consisting of few trees and dominated by dwarf shrubs and perennial plants found in areas where water is retained, such as wadi beds and slopes. The Wadi Jilat 13 and 25 structures are typical of Neolithic Azraq Basin architecture, in that they are curvilinear, semi-subterranean buildings with upright stone surrounds, probably, given the absence of evidence for associated supports, with light and limited superstructures (Baird et al. 1992; Garrard et al. 1994b). This shows a continuity of local traditions, likely defined by resource availability and environmental imperatives that result in a similar style of structure over disparate steppic ranges. There are strong parallels between Wadi Jilat structures, other southern Levantine Neolithic steppe occupations, and those used by present day nomads (Banning and Köhler-Rollefson 1992; Bar-Yosef 1984; Cribb 1991; Digard 1987; Khazanov 1984). Wadi Jilat 13 and 25 ELN steppic structures are notably larger than those of the PPNB in the same region (Baird 1993; Betts 1993; Garrard et al. 1994b), potentially to encompass a larger co-resident group and/or livestock associated with the introduction of herding. The nature of the settlement at ELN Wadi Jilat is different to that at the later Wisad Pools and Wadi Qattafi sites, particularly in terms of numbers of structures and thus likely size of resident population (Rollefson 2016; Rollefson et al. 2014;Rowanet al. 2017). Early phases at Wadi Jilat 13 are radiocarbon dated to 7030–6650 cal BC (OxA1800) and 7030–6600 cal BC (OxA1801). Related deposits contain Byblos, Amuq, Herziliya points and are dominated by Nizzanim points, with the relative importance of PPNB types and absence of Harparsah and Transverse arrowheads further indicating an ELN occupation (Baird 1993). Two dates, 7030–6640 cal BC (OxA2411) and 6830–6510 cal BC (UB3462), from a stratigraphically late phase come from in situ fills of stone-lined hearths set in a stone pavement. The point assemblage in this phase includes extensively pressure flaked Byblos, and Amuq, Nizzanim and Herziliya points, as well as infrequent recovery of Harparsah points and Transverse arrowheads (Baird 1993). Twenty-one m2 of the north-eastern third and the immediate external areas of the Jilat 25 structure were excavated. This contained 60 cm of stratified deposits in two major episodes of deposition; continuous use and reoccupation phases of the structure followed by an episode of infilling. A radiocarbon date of 7070–6810 cal BC (OxA2408) is available for the earliest phase of Wadi Jilat 25 and the point assemblage throughout the three phases was the same; dominated by Nizzanim points (Baird 1993). The absence of Haparsah points and Transverse arrowheads is suggestive of an ELN occupation, but the PPNB/ELN transitional nature of the point assemblage of Wadi Jilat 13 is not seen at Wadi Jilat 25. The Wadi Jilat 25 points appear to post-date the early phase at Wadi Jilat 13 and pre-date the Transverse and Haparsah presence, however, the smaller scale of excavations and resulting sample size at Wadi Jilat 25 makes it difficult to be certain (Baird 1993). While it is not possible to say that the two sites are precisely contemporary, the dates and relative point chronology suggest that they are broadly contemporary.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29405>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Villamar<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> We studied six human individuals and three caprids from the site of Villamar in central Sardinia (Fig 1)(S1 Table for details). Authorization for the use and exportation of the Sardinian specimens was granted by the Soprintendenza Archeologia Belle Arti ePaesaggio per lacittà metropolitana di Cagliari eleprovince di Oristano esud Sardegna, with prot. 15667 of 28 July 2017. Official: Chiara Pilo. All necessary permits were obtained for the described study, which complied with all relevant regulations. The site isaPunic cemetery (4th to early 2nd century BCE), where 25 of approximately 50 known tombs have been excavated since 2013 [25–27](S2 Table for radiocarbon dates). Atotal of 299 isotopic values (δ2H of dentin samples =86 and bone collagen =9; δ15N and δ13Cof dentin samples =93 and bone collagen =9) were produced from these 6humans and 3caprids. The cemetery occupies arocky outcrop of marl and sandstone into which the graves were cut. The prevalent burial ritual isinhumation, with most of the deceased having been buried in either chamber tombs or rock-cut niches, accessible via avertical and roughly rectangular shaft (See S1 Appendix for further site information).The archaeological remains under study were excavated from an ancient cemetery dating to the Punic period, located in the modern town of Villamar in Sardinia, Italy. Extending research carried out in the 1990’s [1], recent and ongoing excavations have focussed on 25 tombs, with the full extent of the cemetery still unknown [2,3]. Many of these funerary structures that were used for burial (chamber tombs or rock-cut niches) were later re-used to accommodate cinerary urns. In some cases, the deceased were placed in ovoid or square trench graves, while, unusually for the Punic period, there were also a number of ‘alla cappuccina’ burials, which were covered by roof tiles. Children were mostly buried in amphorae, or enchytrismos burial [4]. Equally unusual is the deposition of children, in particular new-born babies, together with adults in two of the chamber tombs (T.16 and T.12). All the individuals sampled come from the same rock-cut chamber with a shaft entryway, tomb T.16, which was in use between the 4th and early 2nd century BCE [2,3,5]. They represent four adults and two juveniles, whose permanent first molars were collected for study together with a bone section (see S1 Table for details).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29406>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Uyun al-Hammam<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> \"Uyun al-Hammam lies at an elevation of 200 m asl on an ancient\r\nriver terrace adjacent to a substantial freshwater spring in Wadi\r\nZiqlab, northern Jordan (Fig.1). Excavations at the site between 2000\r\nand 2008 demonstrate repeated use of the site for habitation and,\r\nsubsequently, as a burial ground (Maher, 2007a; Maher et al.,\r\n2011b). A typo-technological analysis of the chipped stone mate-\r\nrial reveals a classic Geometric Kebaran assemblage with a focus on\r\nthe production of bladelets fashioned into standardised trapeze/\r\nrectangles. Portable groundstone tools, including pestles, grinding\r\nslabs, mortars, hand stones, and finer vessels, are present at the site;\r\nhowever, most are fragmentary. While geometric microliths make\r\nup the greatest proportion of the lithic tool assemblage at ’Uyun al-\r\nHammam, it appears that many types of tools were made and used\r\non-site, which is consistent with assemblages expected from long-\r\nterm residential camps rather than ephemeral, specialized\r\nhunting camps (Binford, 1980; Maher, 2005). The presence of\r\ngroundstone tools in the assemblage is notable for signifying the\r\npreparation and utilization of plant material (Maher, 2005). Like\r\ncontemporary sites (e.g. Goring-Morris et al., 2009), other finds\r\ninclude small quantities of bone and shell beads, other modified\r\nshell fragments, bone points/awls, and fragmented worked bone\r\nobjects. Red ochre is also found on-site; however, it generally occurs\r\nas small chunks in occupation-related deposits, especially middens,\r\nor in larger quantities in burial contexts (Maher et al., 2011b). The\r\nsite is estimated to have once covered an area of approximately\r\n1500 m2 and test trenches indicate a depth of at least 1.3 m for\r\nEpipalaeolithic-bearing deposits.Complete human burials were uncovered during large-scale\r\nexcavations at ’Uyun al-Hammam in 2005 and 2008 (Maher,\r\n2007b; Maher et al., 2011a). The material analyzed for this study\r\ncomes from the 2005 season when the Wadi Ziqlab Project exca-\r\nvated a total of seven graves, containing single and multiple\r\ninterments of at least nine individuals in primary and secondary\r\ncontexts. Some of the burials represent the reuse of an earlier grave\r\nand flint implements, groundstone, red ochre, and partial animal\r\nskeletons were found associated with several of the skeletons\r\n(Maher et al., 2011a). These burials more than double the number of\r\nknown human remains from the Middle Epipalaeolithic in the Near\r\nEast. More importantly, these discoveries highlight a deeper chro-\r\nnology for some of the unique mortuary practices characterizing\r\nthe more famous Natufian cemeteries.\r\nThe site is situated at the boundary between oak-pistachio forest\r\nto the east and the more steppic vegetation to the west. The upper\r\nbasin of Wadi Ziqlab where the site is found falls within the\r\nMediterranean climatic zone, where mean annual rainfall reaches\r\nover 400 mm. West of Wadi Ziqlab and towards the Central Jordan\r\nValley, the lower basin shifts into Irano-Turanian Steppe at around\r\n100 m asl, which is accompanied by more arid conditions and mean\r\nannual precipitation averaging 300e400 mm. The Mediterranean\r\nclimatic zone is presently most influential in Wadi Ziqlab, though\r\nthe propinquity of three climatic zones (Mediterranean, Irano-\r\nTuranian, hydrophytic) has probably allowed vegetation patterns\r\nto fluctuate significantly in the past through changes in tempera-\r\nture, precipitation, and, most importantly, human disturbance (fire\r\nand land clearance), including throughout the Epipalaeolithic\r\nperiod. The site is also less than 3 km east of Lake Lisan’s recon-\r\nstructed palaeoshoreline which was at a maximum during occu-\r\npation of the site (Bartov et al., 2002), providing ready access to\r\naquatic food and non-food resources to the occupants of the site.\r\n’Uyun al-Hammam is named after a large permanent spring\r\nacross the wadi from the site that, before capped to supply water to\r\na local village, fed the main drainage of Wadi Ziqlab. Prior to\r\ncapping it exhibited a flow rate of 5.3 m3 per hour, making it one of\r\nthe largest perennial water sources in the area (Al-Shriedeh, 1992).\r\nFor most of the year, Wadi Ziqlab is a dry river bed, except in the\r\nwestern portion of the basin, below 200 m asl, where several\r\nkarstic springs provide year-round water. The marl and limestone\r\nstrata of the Ajlun and Balqa Groups, and their subsequent faulting,\r\nprovide ideal conditions for the formation of aquifers and springs\r\n(Burdon, 1959). Today the water from these springs is diverted for\r\nirrigation and consumption in nearby villages and towns. No doubt\r\nthese springs were more substantial in the past and important\r\nfactors in prehistoric settlement location (Banning et al., 1996).\"<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29407>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Wadi Jilat 13<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The sites of Wadi Jilat 13 and 25 were identified in a programme of survey and excavation in the 1970–80s (Baird 1993;1994 ;2001b ; Baird et al. 1992; Garrard 1998; Garrard et al. 1985;1986 ;1987 ;1994a; 1994b; Wright et al. 2008)(Fig. 1).

At Tell el-Kerkh a PN cemetery that was used for several centuries in the late 7th millennium BC has been excavated in a settlement vacant lot (Tsuneki, 2011). The cemetery covers 200 m2, and includes in excess of 240 skeletons of humans ranging from fetuses to older adults. The skeletons were commonly distributed in clusters within the cemetery, and these may indicate social groups, such as families, that were present in the community. Because the individuals within each cluster were buried intermittently and the clusters developed adjacent to each other over some hundreds of years, no temporal differentiation is evident. Articulated bones were found among secondary burial deposits, indicating that the graves were reopened and reused within short periods of time. This PN cemetery as a communal cemetery not associated with buildings at Tell el-Kerkh make it very different from the PPN graves found within houses, and may indicate a shift in the burial place from private houses to a public space. However, it is not clear whether the advent of the communal cemetery in this Neolithic society was an accommodation to enforce the unification of a large community, or the result of a growing divide within the community.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29414>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Wadi Fidan<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Although today the Faynan region is part of the southern Levant’s Saharo-Arabian desert zone with only ca. 60 mm annual average rainfall in the wadi valleys (Danin, 1983, Rabb’a, 1994), there is evidence that during the Neolithic period a wetter semi-arid environment prevailed. Palynological and freshwater mollusc data from the Wadi Faynan catchment indicate a type of Mediterranean forest with oak, juniper, pine, olive, cypress and elm; average annual rainfall of ca. 200 mm; and meandering streams with associated riparian vegetation before ca. 8000 years ago (Hunt et al., 2004, 2007). Springs fed by groundwater and supporting riparian vegetation in gorges may have existed throughout the Holocene, mitigating the stress of variations in precipitation and mid-Holocene short-term desiccation events on human settlement (Hunt et al., 2007). Neolithic farming and herding may have played a role in vegetational degradation and alluviation such that by the Chalcolithic period the area was “virtually treeless” (Hunt et al., 2004: 928), though overgrazing may not have been significant in Wadi Fidan until the PN or later (Twiss, 2007).

The tomb lies\r\napproximately 50 m to the east of Tell al-Husn. The basic form of\r\nthe vertical shaft tombs consists of a subterranean chamber\r\napproached by a vertical shaft. In some cases, the shaft is very\r\nshallow and the cave is small, while in other cases the shaft is\r\nelaborate and leads into a cave with several chambers (Schaub,\r\n1973).

The cave had been devastated by later reuse (until recently as a shelter for pigs) and possibly looting, besides the infiltration of water that covered many of the artifacts and bone remains with a layer of concretions (Donatella Salvi, personal communication Nov. 2004). Human remains were in highly fragmentary conditions and very friable, and this condition of advanced degradation was confirmed by the poor preservation of collagen. The cultural-chronological attribution of the ceramic sherds pointed to the Bonnanaro A Early Bronze Age aspect (end 3rd-beginning 2nd millennium BC). However, the unpublished AMS date from the University of Lecce (Italy), graciously shared by Dott.ssa Rosalba Floris, placed the sample, provided by the University of Cagliari Department of Experimental Biology, in the early-to-mid 3rd millennium BC (2847-2459 cal BC 2σ, with higher probability in the later part of the period: 2577-2477 cal BC 1σ). Since even the 25th century BC seems too early for a precocious appearance of Bonnanaro A pottery on the East coast, this is to be considered another example of skeletal remains found in caves in disturbed stratigraphies with misleading cultural material associations. In this case the attribution was wisely tested through radiocarbon, and fortunately skeletal remains are still within the time range of the present study, despite their being several hundred years earlier.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29417>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Serra Cannigas<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> No accurate information is available regarding the context of this site, a burial that yielded a wealth of artifacts including pottery, lithics, and probably the highest concentration of metal jewelry and tools in Sardinian prehistory. Apparently it consisted of two lithic cists or tombs (A and B) carved in shallow and soft calcareous rock, which were devastated by plowing. Many of the materials were never recovered, and likely found their way to private collections (Atzeni 1985). The metal finds included several silver spirals and rings, and copper daggers (Usai 2005b: 261). Pottery finds showed a wealth of shapes all attributed to the Copper Age Post-Ozieri tradition, ranging from Melis’ group A-B through C-E, witnessing to a long timespan of utilization. The burials were collective, but the skeletal remains salvaged have never been analyzed. The presence of partially burnt bones may indicate cremation but also could result from later use of the tomb, or even from wild fires after erosion of the topsoil. Among the details of recovery learned from interviewing the archaeologist who directed the operations is the presence of a third series of teeth recognizable in several cranial specimens (Atzeni, personal communication Nov. 2004). However, no such specimens were found in the recovered material at the time of sampling. The one AMS date obtained from bone tissue (3080-2710 cal BC 2σ) fits the general time range of the Post-Ozieri style.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29418>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Seddas de Daga<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> This natural cave utilized as a burial location was discovered by a collapse of the limestone rock matrix that opened up an entrance, in 1974. Looting followed the discovery, so that when speleologists and archaeologists were able to reach the site, they could only document the devastation and collect sherds and bones. The cultural attribution is based on the mixture of skeletal remains with sherds that pertain to the same culturally homogeneous aspect, that of Monte Claro (Alba 1999). Among the bones recovered and stored, mostly large fragments, were crania, vertebrae and long bones, belonging to at least 13 individuals. However, it is reported that at the time of discovery the crania were 17 and they are described as arranged in a circle; furthermore, trepanation was also recorded, although many of these remains have long disappeared (Fruttu and Petrone 1982: 2). AMS dating did confirm the attribution to the chronological phase assigned on stylistic grounds (2866-2493 cal BC 2σ).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29419>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Scaba'e Arriu<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The site is located on gentle slopes on the east side of a group of hills in the Marmilla region. Accidentally discovered in 1983 during works for private construction near the town of Siddi, the structure is a rock-carved tomb with longitudinal plan, articulated in corridor, anticella and funeral room (Badas and Usai 1989). When excavated, the inner burial room was found occupied by Monte Claro pottery and remains, while earlier pottery of Ozieri an\r\n\r\n222 Post-Ozieri tradition was concentrated in the bottom layers of the anticella and of the corridor. The remains of the inner room had been cleared and moved in the anticella, to the sides of a newly built megalithic corridor leading straight to the entrance of the burial room; the roof of the anticella had also partially collapsed (Usai 1998). The tomb, rather than “violated” by “Filigosa and Abealzu peoples” (Usai 1998: 34), was likely used by the same community, that had ancestral links with the first builders who used Ozieri-style pottery, with no discontinuity but a gradual transformation in ceramic style and material culture (see chapter 4). The break is instead apparent with the users of Monte Claro pottery, who cleared the earlier remains and modified the whole structure of the tomb, apparently based on different cult perspectives spreading in the advanced Copper Age. No more offerings of animals are observed in this context, nor lithic utensils accompanying the deceased (Ragucci and Usai 2004: 152-180). There is a tendency for distinction and maintenance of individuality in death, with the separation of select remains into cists arranged within the chamber, and into large jars (Usai 1998: 34-35). On the other hand, the pottery cleared along the earlier remains and found in the anticella and corridor pertains mostly in the phase C (Filigosa II) within Melis’ ceramic framework, with some evidence for earlier and later types (Melis 2000d: 153), and lithic industry is rich and comparable to that of other Copper Age contexts. The importance of the skeletal remains from this site for stable isotopic analyses is great, because it allows us to measure values across two different cultural-chronological phases, overcoming the comparative problem of environmental variability between sites. Three AMS dates enabled me to pinpoint the chronology of the change in pottery style and burial practices, with the Post-Ozieri centered around the 29th-28th century (2902-2634 and 3017-2712 cal BC 2σ), and the Monte Claro around the 26th-25th (2620-2350 cal BC 2σ), with a possible hiatus that would need further chronological testing. Furthermore, this site is crucial since the presence of faunal remains, analyzed by Dott.ssa O. Fonzo, enables us to reconstruct more reliably the foodchain and so identify the protein sources of the human diet more accurately.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29420>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Santa Caterina di Pittinuri<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Located north of Oristano, at a few km from the current coastline (which may have been further away in the time the tomb was carved), it is an isolated domu de janas organized in four rooms, the first being the anticella (room A: see plan in figure 35), preceded by a corridor. Accidentally discovered in occasion of the construction of a road, the tomb was excavated in two campaigns, in 1985 and 1992 (Buffa, et al. 1995). All culturalmaterials point to its carving and use during the Copper Age; utilization lasted through two phases as represented by the difference in pottery shapes, decoration and conditions: the earlier, represented by the basal layer of the anticella, is characterized by open, middle-sized vessels, all in fragments, with some degree of incised and impressed decoration. The later phase, documented in the upper layer of the anticella and in the corridor, shows mostly small cups for individual consumption and closed shapes for liquids, largely undecorated, often intact and laid along the walls (Cocco and Usai 1988: 13-16). Using the phases suggested by Melis, the upper layer corresponds to groups C-D and D (labeled as a transition between Filigosa and Abealzu), and represents the very last aspect of the Ozieri ceramic tradition. The previous phase, not included in her study, due to the prevalence of bowl-like vessels is to be assigned to phases B-C and C (fully within the Filigosa aspect: Melis 2000d: 54-55). Common to both phases are offerings of animal parts, the overwhelming majority being pig mandibles (Fonzo, personal communication 2006); these faunal remains, curated at the Laboratorio di Archeologia in Villanovaforru, were also sampled for isotopic analyses. The three smaller rooms were used as permanent funerary space, with abundant skeletal remains and few artifacts, mostly objects for personal use or adornment (arrowpoints and silver rings), but little pottery. The osteological study, still largely unpublished, shows that all skeletal elements are represented; an MNI of approximately one hundred individuals was calculated from bones, while over 250 were calculated from teeth, many of which were loose, and probably pertain to several generations including the earliest ones not represented by bone remains (Marini, et al. 1997a; 1997b). In fact, the two available radiocarbon dates, one already published, one in this study, cover a long timespan (3355-3030 and 2916-2153 cal BC 2σ). While teeth were studied at the Università La Sapienza in Rome by Prof. Alfredo Coppa and colleagues, only sorting and preliminary analysis were performed on bones in Cagliari. They are currently unavailable because they are stored in the Magazzini Militari, a building that is interdicted due to health and safety concerns. Luckily, a limited number of cranial specimens from room C had not been taken back there with the rest, and were therefore available for sampling at the Department of Experimental Biology of the University of Cagliari. The little information available on pathologies represented in this population concerns its poor dental health: the rate of caries, about 18%, represents an anomalously high frequency (Coppa unpublished), which points to high consumption of fruits. Alternatively, since there is no other evidence for this, consumption of processed cereals could also account for such numbers. Further discussion of dietary reconstruction is below, in the integration with the isotopic results.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29421>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>San Benedetto<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The tomb II of the rock-carved necropolis named San Benedetto is of utmost importance for the Neolithic of Sardinia, because it is the only published intact burial that belongs reliably to the Ozieri phase (Maxia and Atzeni 1964). Most tombs of the domu de janas type, as explained in chapter 4, have been utilized by the same groups for centuries well into the Copper Age, and in most cases even later. AMS dating confirmed the chronological placement in the first half of the 4th millennium BC (raw date in Floris 2001: 3941-3532 cal BC 2σ). In 1961, the site was discovered and partially damaged by excavation for agricultural improvements on a schist hill slope at approximately 500 m asl (although no maps in the literature mark the exact location). After archaeologists documented and recovered contexts and materials, it was re-buried, so it is no longer accessible. Tomb II consists of three rooms arranged in an irregular cross pattern around a central space connected to the entrance; all rooms still had the sealing slabs in situ, in the original placement or slightly moved (Atzeni 2001a; Maxia and Atzeni 1964). The disarticulated remains of 35-40 individuals were recovered in all rooms, with crania and long bones placed in evidence and along the sides. Occlusal wear was present but not frequent, while caries occurrence (7%: Germanà 1995: 51-52) is within the range typical of agricultural societies. This site is important for the whole picture of the isotopic record, due to its being the only collection dating to the Late Neolithic Ozieri (ca. 3850-3300 BC).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29422>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Sa Duchessa (Via Basilicata and Via Tentino)<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> These two denominations belong to the same necropolis, documented piecemeal during the 20th century over a wide area deeply transformed by development in the expansion of the city of Cagliari, comprehensively known as Sa Duchessa. The tombs are at the foot of the several hills that characterize this currently urban landscape, alternating with fertile alluvial soils. Likely connected to the dwellings found uphill near the present-day College of Literature and Philosophy of the University of Cagliari, all tombs were of the same basic type, carved in the sedimentary rock, with a vertical shaft and one or three rooms arranged horizontally. Rooms are irregularly circular or oval-shaped, and inhumations are single or in small groups. The individuals sampled for isotopic analysis are from tombs 1 and 4 in Via Basilicata (Atzeni 1967), and from tomb 1 in Via Trentino (Atzeni 1985). Burial arrangement is quite standardized, with bodies lying flexed on the left side, with one or several vessels near the head. The remains are invariably in very bad conditions, due to water leakage into the tomb and roof collapse that in some cases is likely to have occurred near the time of carving (Atzeni 1967, 1985, 1986). As expected, virtually no collagen was preserved, which besides the stable isotopic analyses also prevented AMS dating.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29423>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Pella<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The site of Pella in Jordan (modern Tabaqat Fahl) is located in the foothills of the east Jordan Valley approximately at sea level (McNicoll et al., 1982, 1992; Smith, 1973). The site (Figure 1) consists of a central settlement mound of perhaps six hectares in the MBA, suggesting a town population of perhaps 1,200 at its greatest extent, not including off-site village and farmstead dwellings which may double that estimate. Blessed with a perennial spring and set beside extensive arable farmlands to the north and west, along with flourishing horticultural zones in the hills to the east and south, Pella enjoyed a mild climate with plentiful winter rainfall, ideal for the mixed agriculture practiced in the MBA. The hills and plains surrounding the site were dotted with farmsteads and forts, small villages and fields, in a territorial unit that very probably stretched from the Jordan River to the arid uplands in the east. (Stantis et al. 2021).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29426>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Padru Jossu<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The grave of Padru Jossu was discovered during digs for irrigation, and excavated in 1980. It consists of a large approximately rectangular pit, with a raised surface on one side, and a few niches. It yielded abundant skeletal remains and artifacts, including pottery, metal items, and rich ornaments made of shells, stone and teeth (Ugas 1982b, 1989). Several layers were accurately documented, with some individuals in partial articulation, witnessing to an occupation lasting through at least three different cultural phases: Monte Claro (very thin basal layer, with a few bone fragments and potsherds), Bell Beaker, and Bonnanaro A, spanning approximately 2700 to 1900 BC according to the current chronology (Tykot 1994). While the excavator believes it to be an underground rock-carved tomb (type domu de janas) whose friable roof collapsed (Ugas 1982b: 19), a comparison with a site excavated in mainland Italy that shows stringent similarities in spatial organization and burial customs may suggest that it was an open-air pit for ceremonies related to the dead (Fosso Conicchio: Fugazzola Delpino and Pellegrini 1999). Moreover, the custom of keeping a funerary site open is proposed also by Manunza (2000; 2005: 148-149) for the pit grave of Iscalitas (Soleminis), which pertains to the Bonnanaro A aspect, considered a later outcome of the Bell Beaker. The importance of the site lies in its wide repertoire of artifacts (Ugas 1998) for material culture aspects previously documented only by early-20th century excavations that did not meet modern stratigraphic standards. Unfortunately, the wealth of anthropological information that the osteological study would yield is not available: most of the remains lie in boxes since the moment they were unearthed. Nineteen crania were randomly sampled for cranial measurements from the three layers: one from the Monte Claro layer, 5 from the ‘decorated’ Bell Beaker layer, 13 from the ‘undecorated’ Bell Beaker layer (Germanà 1982b, 1987; 1995: 90-91, 101-104), which the majority of scholars assimilate to an early aspect of the Early Bronze Age Bonnanaro A; unfortunately, this study did not involve any post-cranial specimens nor did it target any specific paleopathological or behavioral element understandable from the skeleton. Interestingly, two out of five Beaker A individuals had atrophy or agenesis of the same tooth, and 6 out of all 19 individuals showed cribra orbitalia (Germanà 1987), which are likely related to nutrition poor in protein or vitamins, or to parasites (see chapter 5). Animal offerings were present in both main layers, in some cases as halved or whole immature animals, with mostly ovicaprines and no cattle in the Beaker layers, and some specimens of pig and cattle with sheep/goat still dominant in the Early Bronze Age layers. Whole animals were common in phase A and absent in phase B (Sorrentino 1982; Ugas 1998: 277). This was interpreted as reflecting a slight increase in agricultural activities within a mostly pastoral context (Ugas 1982b: 21). The presence of several individuals from two phases makes this site, together with Scab’e Arriu, one of the most important for the research project, which also justifies the number of AMS dates deemed appropriate to maximize the information potential coming from the biochemical investigation. Five determinations (Table 14) enabled us to pinpoint, with the best accuracy up to now, the timing of ceramic styles and cultural change they tend to be associated with.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29427>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Mind'e Gureu<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The exact location of this burial is not reported; the skeletal remains and associated artifacts were accidentally discovered during private construction works, handed over to archaeologists, and later published. No contextual data are known, so that the attribution was based on the ceramic style (Fonzo and Usai 1997), to be later confirmed by the AMS date that was obtained directly from the bone tissue of the one cranium recovered with the materials (2620-2287 cal BC 2σ). The phase appears to be the last Post-Ozieri aspect, labeled Abealzu by the authors (see chapter 4), which can be attributed to the phase C (Filigosa II) according to Melis (2000d: 153): it is close to the cultural material assemblage from the later layer at Santa Caterina di Pittinuri and to much of the Post-Ozieri materials at Scab’e Arriu. The dating, much later than the earliest Monte Claro dates and even slightly later than the one date from the Monte Claro phase at Scab’e Arriu itself, demostrates clearly that the two ceramic styles were partially contemporaneous, potentially for a few hundred years.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29428>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Khirbet Nawafleh<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Khirbet Nawafleh was a village to the North of Petra, and adjacent to Aqaba.

The elaborate temple at Dharih was constructed during the 1st century A.D., when the region was part of the Nabataean kingdom extending over Jordan, southern Israel, and the Sinai peninsula. The rural Nabataean landscape in central and southern Jordan was centered around such religious sanctuaries, as opposed to village economic centers seen in other parts of the kingdom (Villeneuve & al-Muheisen 2003:83).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29434>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Iscalitas<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The site, reported in the literature as Is Calitas, is a pit grave dug on a low hill in an area bordering the plains around Cagliari. Agricultural works for planting a vineyard uncovered bones and sherds, and upon call by local amateur archaeologists the Soprintendenza proceeded to salvageing the information with a scientific excavation in 1995 (Manunza 1998, 2005). The grave yielded Early Bronze Age cultural materials of Bonnanaro A style and a large number of human remains, found mostly as disarticulated elements, with a small number of partially or totally articulated skeletons (Buffa, et al. 2000; Manunza 1998). Two close radiocarbon dates on bone are available, from top and bottom layers of depositions (2290-1899 and 2286-2027 cal BC 2σ). No clear discontinuity was detected in the depositions, which must have continued regularly until the end of utilization. The excavator suggests that during this time the tomb was left open: this would be compatible with its being shallow (about 75 cm), with the skeletons tightly packed but disarticulated and seemingly pushed eastward, and the presence of a ‘midden’ of stones. In one case, a tripod appeared intentionally laid on a small stone slab, which would imply it was standing inside the pit (Manunza 2005: 148). No animal offerings were recovered, while beside the pottery and personal ornaments, about a hundred obsidian flakes were also found. The bare material of these simple flakes, which contrasts with the arrowpoints and formal tools accompanying the dead in previous times, has been interpreted as still holding some special meaning in times of transition between different symbolic-prestige goods, in an age when tool-making by knapping was already declining but obsidian was still somewhat valued (Manunza 2005: 149). The accurate excavation made it possible for this site to document reasonable associations between some human remains and artifacts. This in turn allowed us to assess status by associated grave goods and test isotopically the presence of different diets according to social conditions. The relatively low caries (3%) and high occurrence and degree of occlusal wear also provided an indication of diet, which according to common interpretations would indicate low consumption of processed starch and carbohydrates (Usai, et al. 2005).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29435>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Is Aruttas<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The site is a small natural cave accessible by means of two modified entrances (its meaning is “the caves” in Sardinian), located at a few hundred meters from the Sardinian Sea and a few miles from the currently brackish water Cabras Lagoon. Thorough archaeological information regarding the site of Is Aruttas is yet to be published and likely never will. The context was looted and its cultural-chronological attribution was drawn from the apparently homogenous cultural materials that were associated with the skeletal remains. In reality, only a 20-cm-thick layer containing human bones is reported, which was probably not undisturbed, and the artifacts, assigned to a late phase of the Ozieri period, were admittedly few (Atzeni, pers. comm. in Germanà 1995: 61). This cultural phase, in the late 1970s when the attribution entered the literature, included also what is now referred to as Sub-Ozieri, the Copper Age southern Sardinian evolution of the Ozieri ceramic style; the artifacts, unpublished, are therefore likely to belong to this later time. Remains of 25 individuals were found in burial arrangements evaluated by Atzeni to be both primary and secondary. The general picture the paleopathologist has drawn of this group is that of a healthy population, with balanced and rich nutrition. Among the faunal remains – as well unpublished – several specimens of Prolagus were identified, and one vertebra of whale (Germanà 1995: 55-64). The importance of this collection lay in its being the only large collection attributed to the Late Neolithic other than San Benedetto, but one AMS date obtained directly on bone, compatible with the Late Bronze Age Nuragic, puts such attribution in question (1433-1130 cal BC 2σ).

Due to its strategic location (Fig 1), Himera commanded the sea routes along Sicily’s Tyrrhenian coast, as well as major land routes across the island. Himera was divided into an upper city, with evidence of agricultural processing and stables [22] and a lower city, housing merchants and craftsmen with ready access to the port and agora [19, 22]. While the first Battle of Himera was aPunic attack of Himera, itismore appropriately thought of as the culmination of multiple political skirmishes and alliances between the tyrants of Agrigento, Syracuse, and Himera, and of Sicilian Greek poleis’ differing relationships to the Phoenician world, ranging from friendly to hostile [23]. Political unrest in Sicily inspired Carthage to attack Himera in 480 BCE (Hdt. 7.165) and Gelon, the tyrant ruling Syracuse, came to Himera’s aid to protect his economic and political interests (Diod. 11.20). The Battle of 409 BCE at Himera continued the conflict between Greek hegemony and the personal and economic interests of Punic rulers who had family connections to soldiers killed in 480 BCE (Diod. 13.61). At the beginning of the battle, allied forces from Agrigento and Syracuse rallied to assist Himera, but upon perceiving the threat Carthage posed to their own cities, they departed, evacuating many Himeran citizens in the process as they left (Diod. 13.61). Unaided, relying on all available men, young and old, and fighting “with no thought for their lives” (Diod. 13.61–62) Himera fell and the Carthaginians razed the city and killed remaining citizens who had not already fled. Archaeological excavations at Himera revealed eight mass graves containing 132 individuals, all adult males [24]. Seven graves date to 480 BCE (FC, fossa comune, 1–7) and one to 409 BCE (FC 8+9, originally numbered as separate mass graves but now thought to represent asingle mass grave [25]) based on associated pottery and stratigraphy [22]. Their location on the documented battlefield site, stratigraphic position, dates, adult age, osteological male sex identification [26], and presence of weapons and violent trauma on several of the skeletons suggest they were soldiers [22, 24, 25, 27].<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29437>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Hesban<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The exception mentioned above concerns the Byzantine period. It was apparently during this period that Tell Hesban attained its greatest importance, characterized by the archaeologists carrying out the excavation as a \"major town with temples, churches and acropolis\" (Storfjell 1979; see also Geraty 1977). Judging from the results of the surveys, the settlement density in the area immediately surrounding Tell Hesban was at its greatest (table 5.7). This expansion contrasts with a relatively small quantity of animal-bone finds (fig. 5.2, table 5.8). Only one conclusion can be drawn from this. In a central area consisting principally of religious buildings, the acropolis, there were only a few people living who would produce refuse. The archaeological investigation did not encompass the actual residential area of the \"major town.\" (von den Driesch et al., 1995)<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29438>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Grotta di San Teodoro<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Grotta di San Teodoro is a cave in NE Sicily, situated between the cities of Palermo and Messina (Fig. 1). The cave opens on the northern reaches of the Nebrodi mountain range and is about 2 km south of the present-day shoreline. Excavations at the cave started in 1859, while in 1937 G. Bonafede unearthed a burial (San Teodoro 1) at a depth of 2 m, below an ochre-rich lens (Maviglia, 1940). At the same level, Maviglia recovered human bones of five individuals, including two crania (San Teodoro 2 and 7). The first systematic excavations at the site took place in 1942, under the direction of Paolo Graziosi (1947), with the aim to investigate the stratigraphy of the deposit. Six layers were identified, the first five of which (AeE) are associated with humans. Layer C corresponds to the period of most intense occupation and contained lithics of Late Epigravettian culture (Vigliardi, 1968). The faunal assemblage was dominated by red deer, throughout the sequence, followed by wild boar (Graziosi, 1947; Martini et al., 2007). Aurochs and fox were represented by a few remains, with the former being absent from the top layers (A, B). A small surviving baulk of Layer C, excavated in 1998 (Mangano, 2005), yielded remains of red deer (76% NISP), wild boar (23%), fox (1%) and aurochs (<1%). At the bottom of layer D, there was the lens of ochre, which, as mentioned above, overlaid the Upper Palaeolithic burials (Layer E). The lowermost layer (F) did not contain traces of human occupation, but bones of Pleistocene mammals, including elephant (Elephas mnaidriensis) and hyena (Crocuta spelaea).The faunal remains recovered by Maviglia in the Upper Palaeolithic deposits of Grotta di San Teodoro, stored at the Museo di Storia Naturale in Milan, include a few shells of marine molluscs, such as intertidal limpets (Patella ferruginea, Patella caerulea) and cockles (Cerastoderma glaucum). These molluscs are intact, and it is therefore unlikely that they were taken back to the site by animals, such as seabirds, which leave diagnostic taphonomic signatures on shells (Zuschin et al., 2003). The most likely agent responsible for the introduction of these sub-fossil molluscs were humans, who might have taken them back to the cave for consumption, as at contemporary sites in Sicily and southern Italy (Colonese et al., 2011). Independently of the agent responsible for the introduction of the cockle shells, their presence indicates that lagoons probably existed in the vicinity of the cave, when at the lower sea levels of the Late-glacial the shore would have been around 7.0e8.0 km away (these figures have been estimated using the sea level curve published by Lambeck et al., 2004). No information exists on the presence of fish bones and so it is not known whether the occupants of the cave practiced fishing. Grotta di San Teodoro contained the remains of seven prehistoric humans, six of which (i.e. San Teodoro 1e4 and 6e7) have been attributed to the Upper Palaeolithic (D’Amore et al., 2009). All the individuals are adults, three being female (San Teodoro 1, 4 and 6) and four male (San Teodoro 2, 3, 5 and 7). The craniofacial morphology of the San Teodoro individuals is typical of Upper Palaeolithic West European modern humans and their morphometric characters are most similar to those of coeval humans from southern Italy (D’Amore et al., 2009). It has, therefore, been hypothesized that the San Teodoro individuals descended from modern humans who migrated to Sicily from Italy at some stage after the Last Glacial Maximum. Dental microwear suggests that the diet of the San Teodoro individuals was rich in plant foods, while trace element analyses indicate that it was meat-based. Carnieri and Mallegni (2006) interpret this seemingly contradictory evidence as indicating a mixed, well-balanced diet.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29439>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Göbekli Tepe<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Meat procurement at tenth to ninth millennium cal. BC Göbekli Tepe, which is characterized by a dominance of remains of gazelle in its faunal assemblage, does not differ significantly from that in broadly contemporaneous sites located in the Euphrates River basin (Peters et al. 2013). The site stands apart, though, for reasons of location on top of a hill (800m asl), architecture, symbolism and function (Schmidt 2012). Stone circles measuring more than 15m in diameter and delineated by huge T-shaped limestone pillars are a most conspicuous feature. These pillars are interconnected by stone walls and benches. In the circles’ innermost, probably sacred space, two even taller pillars were positioned. On the pillars rich imagery has been carved, showing Figure 1 Map of the sites mentioned in the text (see Dietrich et al. 2012). 1: Tell Qaramel, 2: Mureybet, 3: Jerf el-Ahmar, 4: Göbekli Tepe. Gazelle behaviour at early Neolithic Göbekli Tepe diverse animal motifs. Species figured include fox, snake, wild boar, aurochs, scorpion, gazelle, Asiatic wild ass and birds. The depiction of arms and hands on them suggests that the T-shaped pillars reflect anthropomorphic beings, but whether these monoliths represent mythical ancestors, theomorphic beings or another kind of supra-natural creature cannot be answered for the moment (Schmidt 2012). Göbekli Tepe probably served as a cultic centre for communities of foragers living both nearby and in more distant places, rather than a permanent settlement site. Large groups of people were involved in its building and possibly also in other communal activities, e.g. feasting (Dietrich et al. 2012). Particularly noteworthy is the fact that, after an undetermined time of use, people backfilled the stone circles intentionally and rapidly with archaeological debris including grinding stones, animal and plant remains, lithics and so on. Such collective performances doubtlessly required considerable logistics, above all in terms of food procurement. It can therefore be postulated that aggregations of people coincided with high population densities of major food animals in the region, such as Persian gazelle, Asiatic wild ass and aurochs.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29440>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Riparo di Fontana Nuova<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The main outcome of our study is to have clarified the chronology of Fontana Nuova, demonstrating that the faunal and human remains, used by Chilardi and colleagues to back up their attribution of the site to the Aurignacian [12], actually date to the Holocene (9900–8500 cal. BP), when Sicily was occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. An attribution of the lithic assemblage to the Aurignacian can now be rejected, not only due to the results of our radiocarbon dating, but also given that the lithic assemblage from this site has been re-assigned to the Late Epigravettian by Lo Vetro and Martini [13]. In fact, the finds only include 2strangulated blades (both not intact, which makes their typological attribution more speculative) and 6 Aurignacian blades [7], representing asmall fraction of the overall complex (ca. 6%), and do not include any animal bone tools, typical of the early Upper Palaeolithic culture in question. Given the similarity between Late Epigravettian and Mesolithic (‘Undifferentiated Epigravetian’) industries in Sicily (where some of the techno-typological features of the latter are rooted in the Epigravettian tradition) [13,55] and in the absence of anew study of the lithic assemblage, itisnot possible to exclude that the site of Riparo di Fontana Nuova, as many others on the island, was occupied by hunter-gatherers of both cultures. However, this hypothetical possibility isnot the most parsimonious interpretation of the radiocarbon data available for the site, because itwould imply that: (1) its small and seemingly discrete assemblage ismixed, and that (2) collagen ispreserved by chance only on bones of Holocene/Mesolithic age, whilst the remains that did not yield collagen are Late Pleistocene/Palaeolithic, or that (3) the lithics are mixed, but the fauna is not.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29441>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Ephesus<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Human remains from the gladiator cemetery (DAM93G) and from the three other excavation complexes marked as DAM92, DAM93NG, and DAM94 were examined (Fig. 1b). The excavations were conducted between 1992 and 1994. The complexes date to the 1st to 3rd century AD, the gladiator cemetery in particular dates to the 2nd to 3rd century AD [82]. Detailed information is given in the excavation reports [83,84] and in the anthropological reports [85,86,87,88]. The burial sites DAM93Gand DAM93NG are located at the northern foot of the Panayırdag ̆ hill about 300 m east of the ancient stadium, between a procession route and an ancient road (Fig. 1b). The human samples from DAM93NG derive from 8 female and 8 male individuals unearthed in 1993 in direct proximity to the gladiator cemetery. The excavation in the nearby ‘‘fig garden’’ revealed a sarcophagus filled with soil and remains of 3 females and 3 males (DAM92). At the opposite side of the Panayırdag ̆ DAM94 was located and revealed burials of 7 females and 8 males in various sarcophagi. DAM93G (the gladiator cemetery) mainly consisted of graves with plain walls and fixed tombstones with illustrations of different types of gladiators (Fig. 2). The human remains were found in an approximately 3 m thick layer in a 20 m2 area (Fig. 1c). Commingled bones indicate that the site was used multiple times over an extended period [83]. Therefore, the documentation and recovery of human remains were carried out according to mass grave excavation methods [89,90]. The morphologic-anthropological examination of the individuals’ sex and age was performed as per [91], [92], [93], [94], [95] and [96]. 53 individuals were analyzed for stable isotope ratios and 35 individuals for Sr/Caratios (Table 1). The sample ID (e.g. EPH-DAM 155/93 rFEM 2), consists of EPH for the location Ephesus, DAM for the excavation site Damianosstoa, 155 is the storage box number, 93 means the excavation year 1993 and rFEM-2 stands for the second right femur in this storage box. Retaining subsamples are stored at the Department of Forensic Medicine in Vienna. The remaining bones are labelled and saved in storage boxes in the sealed depot of the excavation house of the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Ephesus (Atatu ̈rk Mah., 1064 Sok., No 13, TR-35920 Selc ̧uk/ I ̇zmir, Turkey).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29442>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Da'janiya<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The Roman fort at Da’janiya is the largest and best-preserved fortification on the Roman limes between the two legionary forts at Lejjun and Udruh. The fort at Da’janiya is something of an anomaly, since at just over 100 m by 100 m; it covers over four times the extent of the typical castellum in Jordan. There has been some test excavation within the fort itself, limited to establishing the dating of the construction; but until this project there has been no survey of the area surrounding the fort. The fort at Da'janiya is situated on a nearly perfectly flat plain, surrounded by extinct volcanic cones. The presence of watchtowers on these cones provides a wide area of observation and control for the fort. There are also two separate ancient roads, running north/south within the survey area. There is not an extensive settlement around the fort itself, and the fort does seem to be placed to guard the agricultural zone to the west.

In fact, from the literature it was even problematic to reconstruct which cave the remains exactly come from, since two with the same name, indicated with I and II, a few tens of meters apart, yielded archaeological materials. According to Atzeni (1981: xxiii ; 1996a), cave II was already an Early and Middle Neolithic site; cave I yielded Late Neolithic, Late Copper Age Monte Claro, and Bell Beaker materials (Atzeni 1981: xxiii; Ferrarese Ceruti 1981a: lvi, lviii), but both caves were used in the Early Bronze Age by Bonnanaro A groups (Ferrarese Ceruti 1981a: lxvi). However, in early notes (Ferrarese Ceruti 1974a; b: 143-144, note 56), it is in cave II that a wealth of pottery dating the the Early Bronze Age was recovered after the discovery of the site on March 31, 1973, by the Associazione Speleologica Iglesiente. Some pottery represents already an autonomous evolution from shapes that are strictly parallel to Polada types (see chapter 4 on ceramics), which may indicate a somewhat later occupation as compared to the previous Bonnanaro A sites. One AMS date was obtained directly from bone (2202-1963 cal BC 2σ), which confirms the chronology. Among the few cranial specimens, there was a high occurrence of remarkable diploic thickening (Germanà 1995: 130; Maxia and Floris 1961), a hyperostotic condition which is commonly believed to be a symptom of anemia as cribra, but could also be connected to vitamin C deficiency or parasites.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29444>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Çatalhöyük West<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Continuity between the mounds is supported by new research at Çatalhöyük West (Anvari et al. Reference Anvari, Brady, Franz, Naumov, Orton, Ostaptchouk, Stroud, Willett, Rosenstock, Biehl, Steadman and McMahon2017). Many of the changes in material culture observed at the West Mound can be argued to have roots in the cultural trajectory of the East Mound. These include large, probably two-storey, buildings that can be linked to the rapid architectural changes seen in the TP area, and to further expansion of household autonomy. The distinctive painted pottery is also anticipated in the later East Mound sequence by the presence of new shapes and occasional decorated sherds (Last Reference Last and Hodder2005; Özdöl-Kutlu et al. Reference Özdöl-Kutlu, Carter, Czerniak, Marciniak, Hodder and Marciniak2015). Meanwhile, continuity indicated by subsistence data is striking (Russell et al. Reference Russell, Twiss, Orton, Demirergi, De Cupere, Linseele and Hamilton-Dyer2013), and the appearance of additional smaller settlements on the plain after c. 6000 BC (Baird Reference Baird and Hodder2005: 71–73) indicates acceleration of the Late Neolithic trend of greater mobility and more extensive landscape use.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29445>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Çatalhöyük East<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Complex architecture, material culture and art led James Mellaart to identify the 12.5ha mound of Çatalhöyük East as one of the first towns (Mellaart : 15). Çatalhöyük's ‘civilization’ was based on advanced agriculture (ibid.: ch. 11) and finds of stored crops (Helbaek ) proved it. Recently, Çatalhöyük's agricultural basis was challenged and the site recast as a gatherer-hunter village (Balter ). Evidence from renewed excavations refuted this entirely and confirmed the importance of agriculture at the site (Fairbairn et al. ; Asouti and Fairbairn ). A wide range of crops were grown, processed, stored and consumed from the earliest to latest occupation levels. Dietary data also point to consumption of a considerable quantity of plant foods, most probably cereals (Richards et al. ). While some wild foods were used, as on many Neolithic sites, I assume throughout this paper that agricultural production was the key component of the site's food economy. (Fairburn 2007)<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29446>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Cannas di Sotto<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The site is a vast necropolis of still mostly unexcavated domus de janas, located on a low limestone plateau partially incorporated by development into the urban area of the city of Carbonia. Survey and partial excavation of tomb 12 was carried out in 1983. Only the corridor and one room of the tomb was brought to light, so that the extent and complexity of the whole structure is unknown, and only a preliminary report with site plan and select materials has been published (Santoni and Usai 1995: 53-55). Since no materials of classic Ozieri style were recovered, the carving and occupation of the tomb dates to the Copper Age. Since the ossuary-room is directly past the corridor and entrance, the excavated portion may have represented at some point the ritual area (anticella) that possibly later became funerary when ritual activities moved outside (see chapter 4,). Interestingly, no animal remains are mentioned, besides a few bone tools and shells. Human remains, disarticulated, were recovered in no apparent meaningful order in the room, mixed with compact infiltrated soil, pottery, and lithic tools, and one female figurine. The ceramic phase represented is recognized by the excavators as Sub-Ozieri through Filigosa-Abealzu (Santoni and Usai 1995: 58-64), and pertains to Melis’s groups A through C (Melis 2000d: 152), earlier than Santa Caterina di Pittinuri’s main documented phases according to her sequence. This skeletal collection is therefore important as a sample of the Post-Ozieri and early Filigosa phase in the Southwest, and the AMS date fits an early phase of the Copper Age (3349-3023 cal BC 2σ).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29447>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Canhasan III<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Canhasan III was assigned to the Aceramic Neolithic based on an absence of pottery and the presence of distinctive lithics, including large round scrapers, percussion blades and Canhasan Points reminiscent of Amuq Points of the Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic B. Hacettepe University (Ergin Reference Ergin1979) and the British Museum (Burleigh et al. Reference Burleigh, Matthews and Ambers1982; Bowman et al. Reference Bowman, Ambers and Leese1990) produced 16 conventional radiocarbon determinations on unidentified wood charcoal. These were later complemented by two AMS determinations on crop seeds (Gillespie et al. Reference Gillespie, Gowlett, Hall, Hedges and Perry1985: 243–44). Two dates were recent, the others spanning from 7749–7521 cal BC (HU-11; 95.4 per cent probability) to 7055–6427 cal BC (HU-10; 95.4 per cent probability). Twelve dates support an Aceramic Neolithic date of before 7000 cal BC, which marks the beginning of the Ceramic Neolithic at Çatalhöyük (Bayliss et al. Reference Bayliss, Brock, Farid, Hodder, Southon and Taylor2015). Samples HU-9, HU-10, OxA-388 and BM-1655 suggest that occupation at Canhasan III extended beyond 7000 cal BC (for details of all these dates, see Table S1 in the online supplementary material (OSM)). These dates, however, do not follow the stratigraphy, with the most recent date (OxA-388) coming from the deepest layer. At the time, this was believed to be the result of the other determinations suffering from an old wood effect, in which dated samples came from long-lived timbers and did not reflect the date of their incorporation into the archaeological record (Gillespie et al. Reference Gillespie, Gowlett, Hall, Hedges and Perry1985). A further problem with all published dates was uncertainty in phasing—only clarified by French (pers. comm.) in 2015—which made the establishment of reliable dating sequences impossible (Fairburn et al. 2020)<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29448>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Çamlıbel Tarlası<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Over three seasons (from 2007 to 2009) Çamlıbel Tarlası was excavated under the direction of one of the authors (U-DS) with the express aim of expanding knowledge of prehistoric settlement, chronology and economy in north-central Anatolia. Çamlıbel Tarlası was a small, short-lived settlement located on a small plateau (c. 1040 m asl) in a narrow valley, approximately 3 km from the main Budaközü Plain, in the Turkish province of Çorum (see Fig. 1; Schoop, 2010, 2011b, 2015). The main activities attested at the site are agriculture and extractive metallurgy. Palynological evidence indicates that the wider region was forested (Dörfler et al., 2000; Marsh, 2010). Surrounding plateaus would have been ideally suited to small-scale agriculture (cultivation and livestock husbandry). An outcrop of copper ore is located ~ 2 km to the east of the site (Marsh, 2010). Seven phases of activity have been identified at Çamlıbel Tarlası (Table 1) and these have been dated to the Late Chalcolithic (Table 2). The earliest phase of activity (ÇBT I) is represented by numerous bowl furnaces, possible copper smelting installations cut into the ground surface and insulated with layers of potsherds, stones and clay. Following this initial phase of activity, there were three construction phases (ÇBT II, ÇBT III and ÇBT IV) interspersed with three non-architectural phases (phases of ephemeral use FPEU, SPEU and TPEU) during which Çamlıbel Tarlası saw human activity probably on a seasonal basis. The whole sequence dates between 3650 and 3375 cal BC (Table 2).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29449>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Boncuklu<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Boncuklu Höyük appears to have been established on a rise within a wetland area. Evidence for the use of crop plants at Boncuklu is clearly present but sparse, and foraging was probably more important than farming. Seasonality proxies suggest that the site was occupied throughout the year, but the community may well have included more mobile groups that were absent at different times (Baird et al., 2012, 228–232). Excavation of several areas with a combined exposure of over 400 m2 has revealed houses with painted floors, bucrania and clay and plaster relief decoration, predating similar practices at the nearby site of Çatalhöyük by about a millennium (Baird et al., 2012, 233–235). A sequence of six buildings, reconstructed one above another, has been excavated in one area (Area K); as at Çatalhöyük, continuous reconstruction in the same place appears to have been important. The buildings at Boncuklu were c. 3 × 5 m and ellipsoidal with the walls made from mudbrick. The buildings showed evidence of ground-level entry, unlike at Çatalhöyük where entry was from the roof. As at Çatalhöyük, however, there is strong evidence for a highly structured use of internal space, and the presence of plaster installations and painting (Baird et al., 2012). Extensive midden deposits accumulated in open areas and were associated with hearths and lightweight structures that may have formed shelters for work areas.

Successive excavations have uncovered two Byzantine churches; one with a plastered floor, while the other has a mosaic one, hundreds of cisterns that were used for water storage, a chapel, many wine and olive presses, and three cemeteries that are dated to the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. Based on pottery sherds and artifact assemblages, occupation of the site started during the early Bronze Age and continued throughout the Middle Bronze Age, the Hellenistic Period, the the Byzantine Period and lately during the Islamic Period.

The site represents a model of mixed subsistence strategies: agriculture, industry, and trade. Barsinia is located west to the city of Irbid, occupying an area of about 112 km2 (Figs. 1 and 2). The archaeological excavations at the site revealed an occupation that started during the Iron Age and continued till the Ottoman period. The uncovered remains at the site, however, showed great prosperity during the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Umayyad periods in particular. The diversification in tomb types and grave goods as well as other recovered artifacts during the Late Roman/Early Byzantine point to a hierarchical society who subsisted on agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and trade (Fig. 3). The presence of complex tombs and some fine industries like wine and metal infer wealth accumulation. The people of Barsinia practiced trade with Anatolia, North Syria, North Africa, and locally with the nearby urban centers such as Gerasa (Jerash) and Pella (Tabaqat Fahil). The archaeological records of the site remained silent on the interactions with other established settlements either locally or centrally, leading one to assume that Barsinia may have attracted nonlocal settlers or originally been established by people not originally from the region. The archaeological analysis did not introduce clues on population mobility and originality, which this study intends to investigate on through using strontium isotope analysis from human tooth enamel.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29452>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Trail River 1 [NfVi-8]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=23643>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Town Cave #2<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=23644>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Gupuk [NiTs-1]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=23645>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Hickory Creek locality<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=23661>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>American Fork Canyon Cave [42Ut014V]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=23663>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Fyllan Cave Local Fauna [TMM40682]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Small solution cavities north wall of Murchison Quarry about 6.7 m from top of quarry.

southwestern tip of Virginia.\r\nSediments consist of loosely packed Quaternary alluvium composing eight different stratigraphic units ranging in age from upper Holocene to ~27,000 ka (McDonald, 1984). The units are primarily fluvial and lacustrine in origin and suggest periodic transitions between moist swampy areas and drier fluvial systems as evidenced by cycles of peaty muds and silty–sandy clays. The vegetation varied from sedge meadows and alder swamps to pine and spruce forests (Ray et al., 1967; McDonald, 1984). [The city of Saltville lies within two counties, Smyth and Washington. With the lack of a close up map of the region, the coordinates are rough.]<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5663>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Lost River Sink<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5664>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Bear Town Cave<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5665>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Guy Wilson Cave<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5666>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Dutchess Quarry Cave<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5667>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Dewey Parr<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5668>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>John Green [44GV1]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5669>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Elm Hill [44MC78]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5670>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Sours [44WR2]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5671>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Lauderdale [44BO3]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5672>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Brown Johnson [44BD1]<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> NA<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=5673>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>T.

Like most of the 153 recorded prehistoric archaeological sites on the Fox Islands, the Turner Farm site is a shell midden situated on a relatively level terrace facing a gravel beach... The Turner Farm site is in a protected location facing Fox Islands Thorofare (Figure A5.3). The site is on a terrace and eroding bluff at the northern end of a small gravel barrier beach between Fish Point and Kent Cove. Modern environments include a fresh to brackish back-barrier marsh, sand and gravel barrier, and eroding bluffs of glacial sediment sitting on a bedrock ledge. Tidal flats containing Mya arenaria exist within 1-2 km NW and N of the site today, but the immediate intertidal area is a relatively steep, coarse-grained beachface.

<p>The temporal extent of the FAUNMAP database is a little bimodal:
about half the records have a plio-pleistocene time scale, and the other
half have a more holocene time scale. (And only 4815 of the 6950
datasets have any time range associated with them at all.)</p>
