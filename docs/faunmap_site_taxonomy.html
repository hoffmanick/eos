archaeo and QA/QP//Q/T</h2>
<p>These sites are archaeological by some indicator and are fuzzed to
the quadrangle level, and they have units more specific than
presence/absence. Well, “Q” is a little ambiguous. Only five sites have
geographic precision Q and there’s no metadata about what it means. To
be safe, we’ll assume it means quadrangle level fuzzing.</p>
