Like most of the 153 recorded prehistoric archaeological sites on the Fox Islands, the Turner Farm site is a shell midden situated on a relatively level terrace facing a gravel beach... The Turner Farm site is in a protected location facing Fox Islands Thorofare (Figure A5.3). The site is on a terrace and eroding bluff at the northern end of a small gravel barrier beach between Fish Point and Kent Cove. Modern environments include a fresh to brackish back-barrier marsh, sand and gravel barrier, and eroding bluffs of glacial sediment sitting on a bedrock ledge. Tidal flats containing Mya arenaria exist within 1-2 km NW and N of the site today, but the immediate intertidal area is a relatively steep, coarse-grained beachface.

"5663","Saltville Quarry","The fossil bearing strata of the Saltville Valley are located in the southwestern tip of Virginia.
Sediments consist of loosely packed Quaternary alluvium composing eight different stratigraphic units ranging in age from upper Holocene to ~27,000 ka (McDonald, 1984). The units are primarily fluvial and lacustrine in origin and suggest periodic transitions between moist swampy areas and drier fluvial systems as evidenced by cycles of peaty muds and silty<U+2013>sandy clays. The vegetation varied from sedge meadows and alder swamps to pine and spruce forests (Ray et al., 1967; McDonald, 1984). [The city of Saltville lies within two counties, Smyth and Washington. With the lack of a close up map of the region, the coordinates are rough.]","<U+13E3><U+13B3><U+13A9> <U+13A6><U+13EC><U+13C2><U+13AF><U+13CD><U+13D7> Tsalagi Gawonihisdi (Cherokee)","34555","cherokee-2"
