<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>As part of Neotoma’s participation in the Ethical Open Science for
Past Global Change Data RCN, we are <a
href="https://hoffmanick.github.io/eos/neoHomo.html">auditing our
records</a> for sensitive data, especially data which are sensitive with
respect to the CARE principles.</p>
<p>The main audit document is based on programmatic searches of Neotoma
metadata. These structured metadata are curated by a community of
experts, so they’re a highly accurate source for making determinations
about Neotoma’s holdings. However, they are necessarily limited in
scope. This page documents our attempt to extend our audit through
programmatic searches of the full texts of publications associated with
datasets in Neotoma according to Neotoma’s metadata. This corpus is more
extensive, but it is harder to draw conclusions from our hits because it
is unstructured.</p>
</div>
<div id="neotoma-publications-indexed-by-xdd" class="section level1"
number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Neotoma Publications
Indexed by XDD</h1>
<p>Neotoma contains 14194 records. Of these 14194 records, only 3137
have DOIs. 7 of the DOIs are problematically formatted. Of the 3130
(22.1 %) articles with unproblematic DOIs, I searched for how many had
internal document ids (XDD ids), by looping all the DOIs through the API
call: <code>https://xdd.wisc.edu/api/articles?doi=</code>. Only 1381
(9.7 % ) publications had an internal ID with XDD. For all searches
conducted so far, only publications with an internal XDD id seem to have
been indexed by XDD. However, I conduct the following searches using
DOI, not internal XDD ID, just in case…</p>
<p>Of the 3438 distinct publications associated with the FAUNMAP
database, and of the the 3634 distinct publications associated with
datasets of type vertebrate fauna (overlap of 3399), only 354 and 393
have DOIs associated with them, respectively. That’s 10.3 % and 10.8 %
respectively, or about 0.5 of the overall percentage of Neotoma
publications with a known DOI. Only 91 FAUNMAP publications (2.6 %) and
105 vertebrate publications (2.9 %) are indexed by XDD. This low
percentage matters because the datasets most likely to contain sensitive
data are those from the FAUNMAP database and those that concern
vertebrate fauna.</p>

behavior that demonstrates compliance with the spirit of the CARE
principles. Below I outline searches for</p>

<p>I searched through the text of Neotoma publications with

suggestive of a potential fuzzing process:</p>

that I’m having trouble searching for the symbol “#”. When I use the URL
encode function, the transformation to “%23” doesn’t happen for some
reason. So I manually transform the url to reflect that encoding, but
the API doesn’t understand what I’m asking for. Or I don’t understand
how to ask the API for what I want.</p>

Recognized Tribe Official Names</h3>
<p>Naming a federally recognized tribe would be suggestive of a
collaboration between researchers and the tribe named. I searched all
Neotoma publications with unproblematic DOIs for any mention of the
following official names of federally recognized Indigenous nations.
This took a long time (576 * 3130 calls), so I stored the results and
will just call those up here.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Radiocarbon from Human
Samples</h1>
<p>As part of our interest in our repository’s relationship to CARE, we
want to know about the disposition of the remains of human ancestors,
for both radiocarbon dates and samples. There are 44630 records in
Neotoma’s geochronology table, of which there are 7000 records ambiguous
with respect to taxon (meaning the <i>materialdated</i> field is bone
collagen, bone, blank, or NA). We would like to search for those
ambiguous taxa which are most likely to be dated from human
material.</p>
<p>We searched for all the publications in Neotoma associated with these
ambiguous records and found 897 records. Of these records, only 209 have
an unproblematic DOI, and 45 have an internal XDD ID.</p>
<p>I searched through all the Neotoma publications associated with an
ambiguous taxon and with a DOI for the following terms:</p>
