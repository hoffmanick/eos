Some of the data on the LPC website are simply originals of data Grimm incorporated into the NAPD, but kept there for people who want easy access (Excel spreadsheet). In addition, the LPC website is used to fulfill open-access responsibilities - as a place to put newly created pollen and paleolimnology data (mostly from the Arctic and northern Canada), for modern calibration databases (which include matched microfossil and environmental data), and also for climate reconstructions, protocols, and other work.

""The main types of data included in the DPDC are site information, diatom counts, water chemistry and other environmental data, and chronologies. The DPDC was initially funded by NOAA and NSF from 1994 - 2008 with grants to the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.  NSF provided continued support to facilitate transfer of data to Neotoma.  Data that were included in the original DPDC and available via the DPDC website at ANSP have not been accessible to retrieve since 2021.  This  constituent database within Neotoma is now the primary source of DPDC data.

Data downloaded from this constituent database should be cited, as well as the original source publications and investigators whenever possible. Please use the following as an example: “Data were obtained from the Diatom Paleolimnology Data Cooperative, a constituent database of the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (https://www.neotomadb.org/). The work of data contributors, data stewards, and the Neotoma and DPDC communities is gratefully acknowledged.”",,No,Yes,"This CD contains stratigraphic and surface sampe diatom counts, plus water chemistry for lakes in North America.
