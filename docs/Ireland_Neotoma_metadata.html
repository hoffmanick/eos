It is an important habitat for Greenland white-fronted geese during winter months. It also supports a pine and birch woodland in the centre, containing unique insect fauna indicitive of ancient woodlands. Two principle vegetation types occur; ombotrophic bog vegetation and flushed areas. The nutrient flushes are due to the upwelling of groundwater on the bog surfaces.","Relatively intact midlands raised bog, with an estimated 29% cut away (mostly on the north east edge).

The mountains are composed predominantly of granite with contact aureole schists at the margins. The steep sided valley was deepened by glacial activity during the last glaciation (Coxon et al. 2012). The valley is flooded by two lakes which are separated by an alluvial fan deposited by a stream flowing down the centre of the southern wall of the valley. The Lower Lake (Irish Grid ref: T 118 966; Long. 06˚20’30”W Lat. 53˚00’30”N) is bounded on its western margin by the alluvial fan, the north and south margins are the steep valley sides and the eastern margin at the mouth of the valley is formed by a delta derived from an earlier lake that filled the valley (Coxon et al. 2012). The Upper Lake flows into the Lower Lake via a river that has cut through the fan deposit. The Lower Lake is approximately 300 m long (east-west) and 150 m wide (north-south); water depth is 13 m at its deepest point. The Lower Lake lies at an altitude of 130 m OD. The valley walls are now covered by semi-natural oak woods and plantations of exotic conifers which open out onto mountain heathland at higher altitudes. During the last century, mining activity led to the lowering of the water level in the Lower Lake by two metres (Anon 1990). The coring site was on the western margin of the Lower Lake. This was in the shore zone that is seasonally flooded. Due to the lowering of the water level in the last century, the sediments were lacustrine (rather than alluvial fan) deposits and were overlain by peat.","The Glendalough valley is cut into the eastern flank of the Wicklow mountains.

They form an east-west ridge covering 22 km which rises steeply to an altitude of 919m at its highest point. The surface bedrock is Devonian conglomerates and Old Red Sandstone which overlies a core of Silurian shales. Quaternary glacial and periglacial action formed a string of cirques on the north facing flank of the mountain ridge.","The Galtee Mountains (or Na Gaibhlte in Irish) lie in the southern part of the country and are Ireland's highest inland mountain range.

<p>I join all my different metadata together. Before I do that, I grab
the x/y version of the coordinates instead of the sf version, which
doesn’t render well in tables. Because of the one-to-many and
many-to-many relationships among Neotoma tables, there are a lot of
records in the below data table. But only about 100 Neotoma sites in
Ireland, associated with about 300 datasets, and 64 publications. (And
of those 300ish datasets, 62 are geochronologic type, which is a little
artifactual, but I’m including it below for completeness.)</p>
